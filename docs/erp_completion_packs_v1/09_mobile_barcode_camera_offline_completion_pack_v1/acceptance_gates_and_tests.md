# Acceptance Gates and Tests — Mobile / Barcode / Camera / Offline Completion Pack v1

    ## Gate 1 — Repo Inspection Evidence

    Codex must report what it inspected:

    - models/entities/tables;
    - API routes/controllers/services;
    - UI screens/components;
    - tests/audit scripts;
    - existing disabled actions or fake placeholders;
    - current data flow from source document to target document.

    ## Gate 2 — P0 Functional Completion

    Required P0 checks for this pack:

    - Barcode/camera must not be desktop-only placeholders; screens must support scan event handling, validation, manual fallback, and error feedback.
- Offline queues must be durable, idempotent, retryable, and conflict-aware; no silent loss when network changes.
- Device trust must store device identity, user, role, warehouse/plant scope, last seen, revoked/active status.
- Bin/lot/serial scans must be context-specific: a valid item barcode alone is not enough for bin-managed or serialised stock.

    ## Gate 3 — Save / Reopen / Refresh

    For every new or touched screen:

    - create record;
    - save;
    - refresh/reopen;
    - verify header values;
    - verify all line values;
    - verify attachments/documents if any;
    - verify status/action availability.

    ## Gate 4 — Cross-Pack Truth Checks

    Even when this pack is not primarily sales/finance/warehouse, Codex must state whether the pack touches these areas and verify accordingly.

    | Area | Required check |
    | --- | --- |
    | Salesperson / owner | Quote/SO/customer/service ownership preserved and visible where relevant. |
    | Remarks | Internal and customer-facing remarks persist and flow into documents where relevant. |
    | Price / discount / tax | Effective-dated source, snapshot, override reason, totals, rounding where touched. |
    | Bin / location / lot / serial / PCID | Required controls enforced for stock movements where touched. |
    | Revisions | Exact source revision references stored and shown where touched. |
    | Reports / exports | Outputs use real data and durable file/export job metadata. |
    | Attachments | Uploads use persisted entity metadata and permissions. |
    | Mobile / integration | Runtime success is not faked. |

    ## Gate 5 — Automated Tests

    Minimum tests/manual evidence required:

    - Scan bin+item+lot for inventory issue; verify validation and persisted scan events.
- Go offline, capture mobile transaction draft, reconnect, sync, verify idempotent posting.
- Capture photo for QC/POD/service; verify attachment metadata and entity link.
- Register/revoke device; verify revoked device cannot post.
- Create conflict by changing stock while offline; verify conflict queue and no silent bad posting.

    ## Gate 6 — Residual Gap Report

    Codex must produce a pack report with:

    - completed features;
    - files changed;
    - tests run;
    - remaining gaps;
    - business decisions required;
    - exact disabled actions left;
    - next recommended pack/action.

    ## Rejection Criteria

    Reject the pack if any of these happen:

    - success toast without persistence;
    - action opens empty modal without functional workflow;
    - fields save only in local component state;
    - totals calculate only first line;
    - governed field becomes free text;
    - numeric field is stored as arbitrary string;
    - old transaction mutates after revision/master change;
    - provider/mobile/offline success is marked without evidence;
    - final report omits tests or cross-pack truth checks.
